# Automated-Attendance-and-Cumulative-Feedback-System
Face recognition is an important technological development
of this era. It is being widely used in biometric systems,
gaming as well as to tag people on social media. It is also
being used for attendance as the manual system is a tedious
and time-consuming one. This paper proposes an automated
attendance and cumulative feedback system based on facial
expression recognition. To introduce automation into this process,
a system has been implemented which recognizes students from
a recorded video of the class and captures their attendance.
This paper addresses another issue of feedback of the professor
by deducing genuine and cumulative feedback based on facial
expressions of the students. Local Binary Pattern Histograms
(LBPH) and Eigen Face recognizers have been used for face
recognition with accuracies of 97% and 95% respectively. Two
methods have been proposed for deducing the feedback. One is
the algorithmic method based on face recognition and the other
one uses machine learning algorithms like feature extraction,
clustering, classification and validation. It is observed that the
proposed automated feedback evaluation is in correlation with
the manual one.
